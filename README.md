# Bank-Form-Automation-and-Feedback-Processing
Even to make withdrawal/deposits, bank customers have to 
constantly manually fill the same data of contact and 
payment information at multiple locations each and every 
time they would want to make a withdrawal or deposit at a
bank. This reduces efficiency at bank branches and is also 
very inconvenient for the bank’s customers.

To help solve this problem, we have tried to create an 
online portal where the only information required from a 
customer would be the basic details of the person and 
his/her bank account. The portal automatically reduces 
redundant information Filling and automatically takes care 
of certain bank requirements in the form like entering the 
date, location of the branch and other necessities like 
converting numeric data to words and etc. This portal 
enables customers to effortlessly–and accurately fill their 
withdrawal/deposit forms and just asks for their bank 
account number and contact number. It then directly
fetches the remaining information from the banks database 
with the given details and creates a form automatically of 
the amount specified.
